- **Portfolio Section**: A grid layout displaying a selection of projects (images for now, could be linked to real projects in the future).
- **Contact Section**: Provides links to my email and GitHub profile for easy communication.
- **Scroll to Top Button**: A button that appears once you scroll down, allowing you to quickly go back to the top of the page.
